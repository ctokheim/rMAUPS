\usage{
DeComplex(depres, type = "GOBP+GOCC+CORUM+REACTOME", lfc = "log2FC",
  pval = "pvalue")

ssNES(mat, gsType = "Complex", method = "gsva")
}
\arguments{
\item{depres}{normalized count matrix; rows are all genes in the signature that
shall be summarized into one score; columns are samples}

\item{type}{Molecular signatures for testing, available datasets include Pathway
(KEGG, REACTOME, C2_CP), GO (GOBP, GOCC, GOMF), MSIGDB (C1, C2 (C2_CP (C2_CP_PID, C2_CP_BIOCARTA),
C2_CGP), C3 (C3_MIR, C3_TFT), C4, C6, C7, HALLMARK) and Complex (CORUM). Any combination of them
are also accessible (e.g. 'GOBP+GOMF+KEGG+REACTOME').}

\item{lfc}{Gene sets.}

\item{pval}{("PC", default), Pearson, ssGSEA or mean (other value). fisher, stouffer.}

\item{mat}{A matrix.}

\item{gsType}{Molecular signatures for testing, available datasets include Pathway
(KEGG, REACTOME, C2_CP), GO (GOBP, GOCC, GOMF), MSIGDB (C1, C2 (C2_CP (C2_CP_PID, C2_CP_BIOCARTA),
C2_CGP), C3 (C3_MIR, C3_TFT), C4, C6, C7, HALLMARK) and Complex (CORUM). Any combination of them
are also accessible (e.g. 'GOBP+GOMF+KEGG+REACTOME').}

\item{method}{Method to employ in the estimation of gene-set enrichment scores per sample.
By default this is set to gsva (HÃ¤nzelmann et al, 2013) and other options are ssgsea
(Barbie et al, 2009), zscore (Lee et al, 2008) or plage (Tomfohr et al, 2005). The latter two
standardize first expression profiles into z-scores over the samples and, in the case of zscore,
it combines them together as their sum divided by the square-root of the size of the gene set,
while in the case of plage they are used to calculate the singular value decomposition (SVD) over
the genes in the gene set and use the coefficients of the first right-singular vector as pathway
activity profile.}
